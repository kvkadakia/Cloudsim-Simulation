Hi Karan,
thank you for your submission. You may consider learning scalatest and
using behavioral testing, but it is ok for now. Your code is well-commented
and you provided some info in README, but no tests. You used mutable
variables even though you didn't have to - please think about how you can
modify your code to avoid doing it. Your policy implementation is rather primitive one
and you didn't analyze the results of your simulations in depth. Yet, the quality of
the basic implementation is sufficient - you have partial grade, 2.5%.
